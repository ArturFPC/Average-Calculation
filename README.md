# Average-Calculation
This is a program created in fortran using Visual Studio as IDE, it was carried out as a final work of the programming paradigms discipline, it is a simple example of calculating the average from two files, one input and the other output.
In this project an input file called input.txt and an output file called output.txt were used, each line of input.txt is expected to have an integer, and in the output file when compiling the program, there should be calculating the averages of whole numbers.
For this problem I used vector unnecessarily, because I wanted to explore more language tools.
